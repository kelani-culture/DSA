State the problem clearly Identify the input & outputs formats
Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases
Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English
Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify  inefficiency.  Repeats steps 3 to 6 times
Applying the right technique is where the knowledge of common data structure and algorithms comes in handy
